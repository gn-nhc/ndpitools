  Compiling and installing the NDPITools
  --------------------------------------

1. Prerequisites:
- an installed version of the make utility, in the PATH
- an installed C compiler, in the PATH
- optionally an installed version of the zlib library
- optionally, if compiling with libjpegturbo, an installed version of 
the cmake utility and an assembler (e.g. nasm or yasm), in the PATH
- a UNIX-like shell.

2. Download the source distribution file ndpitools-<VERSION>.tar.bz2 and 
untar it:

tar xfj ndpitools-<VERSION>.tar.bz2

3. Go into the source directory:

cd ndpitools-<VERSION>

4. Run the build_ndpitools.sh shell script:

sh build_ndpitools.sh

Hopefully this will work for your platform (tested with Mac OS 10.5, 
10.6, 10.7, 10.11, 10.13, 10.15, Linux Debian and Ubuntu, MinGW).

5. The produced binaries are then in the subdirectory bin of 
ndpitools-<VERSION>. Feel free to install them in the relevant place; 
e.g.:

cp bin/* /usr/local/bin

under Linux. This last command should be executed as a superuser (e.g. 
add sudo in front of the command line).
